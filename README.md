The Technical Support Dashboard project visualizes and tracks the performance metrics of a technical support team, providing detailed insights into ticket management. It highlights key areas such as ticket volume, types of issues (e.g., product setup, pricing/licensing, feature requests), and geographical distribution. The dashboard also monitors SLA compliance and agent workload, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies. 

The primary problems identified include high ticket volume, complex product setup processes, confusion over pricing/licensing, and unmet feature requests. The project aims to enhance support efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline issue resolution by providing actionable data insights.
